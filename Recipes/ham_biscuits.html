    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup shortening, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>3 cups flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cream tartar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups whole buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon bacon grease or shortening</li>
        <li>3 slices country ham</li>
        <li>Softened butter, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220 degrees C. Grease an 8-inch cast-iron skillet with shortening.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl or the bowl of a food processor, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cream of tartar. Mix or pulse a few times to combine.</li>
        <li>Cut butter and 1/4 cup shortening into flour mixture just until you get a crumbly consitency. Add buttermilk to flour mixture. Gently stir until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Turn out dough onto a floured surface. With floured hands, pat dough to approximately 2-inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 6 to 8 biscuits. Transfer to greased skillet. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove biscuits from oven and let cool 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>While biscuits are baking, cook ham: Add bacon grease to a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add ham slices and fry until edges are brown, a few minutes per side. Remove ham from skillet and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cut each slice in half.</li>
        <li>To serve, split each biscuit in half, spread with softened butter, and sandwich with a piece of ham.</li>
    </ol>
